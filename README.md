# Creation of Crypted.
Crypted is an app designed by students from the University of Palermo (UP) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and coded by Tomas Cabrera student from North Carolina Wesleyan University (NCWU) in North Carolina, United States. This app was designed in the University of Palermo for the course "DiseÃ±o de Imagen y Sonido" and then it was coded as a personal project of Tomas Cabrera with the authorization of the students that designed the project.

> All the texts inside the images are in Spanish as this was created for an Spanish design course.

# What is Crypted?
Crypted is a cryptocurrency investment application like Binance, Crypto.com and Coinbase but with social media implementations, where people. can upload their investment ideas in a forum or ask questions to certificated professionals. The user profile we are targeting is someone who invests in cryptocurrencies but do not have enough knowledge about them. This is a personal project application and it's not intended for real use, so for now it is not implementing any blockchain technologies for trading. It may become a DEFI application in the future, but for now it's just and idea.

# What is the objective of Crypted?
The main objective of our application is to encourage those who have interest in cryptocurrencies to start investing, or those who already invest, to continue doing so but with greater ease and provide them with all the necessary information to do it correctly. In addition, there is an attempt to relate the user to other people who share your interests, who can answer your questions, and even consult with professionals on the subject. From a forum to videos and articles in the form of tutorials, our app provides the users with everything they need to stay aware of what is happening in the innovative and constantly changing world of cryptocurrencies.
